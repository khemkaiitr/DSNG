3. [sparkify](https://github.com/khemkaiitr/DSNG/tree/main/sparkify): Project to predict user's churn using pyspark

## Project details:
For detail of each project, go through projects readme.
1. write a blog post: In this I analyse life-style data and its impact on stress. A medium blog is written for it. blog link (pending)
2. Disaster response: I use disaster response data from figure8 to build a classification model to classify responses into different categories.
3. recommendation_ibm: Built a recommendation model to recommend new articles to user
4. Sparkify: I use pyspark to classify whether a user is going to churn or not
