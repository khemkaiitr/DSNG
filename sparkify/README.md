# Sparkify project

## Project motivation:
In this project, I use customer's music activity data from a hypothetical music streaming service provider called  `Sparkify` to predict churn

All the business thrive upon loyal customers but at the same time, customer churn is a reality. Customers can leave the company due to high charges, unsatisfactory services or products or other unforeseen events. For a company losing customers mean a decrease in revenue.
Thus, it becomes important to identify reasons behind customer's churn and if possible predict in advance which customers are more prone to churn. And, this knowledge can help companies in taking measures to retain customers.
