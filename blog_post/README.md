## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
In this project I am interested in analysing health insurance data from Kaggle to understand:
1. How BMI relates to daily activites and fruit & vegetable intake
2. Relation of stress in different genders (and is there anny effect of age)
3. Who is more social, men or women?

## Start guide <a name="start guide"></a>
